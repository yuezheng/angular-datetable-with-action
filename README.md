The goal of this project is to show how to create a angular
data table component step by step.

The table component is originates in routine work.

In our font-end product, we need table to display items from
server side, it to be required some flexibility to use,
and rich additional features such as sort/filter etc.

I want to restore the iterative process in real development.
Create a component from simple to complex, features from poor
to rich, from turbid to ordered.

I want describe by follow steps:

1. Create component via directive;
2. Create component via module;
3. Create component via app.
